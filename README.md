# Disable Xiaomi A1 nav buttons

This module disable both the backlight and the function of the Xiaomi A1 navigation buttons.

You can easily edit this module (or ask me to edit it) to keep the buttons enabled and change the layout (to obtain the classic "Back - Home - Menu") or just disable the backlight.

Please note that this module does not enable the navbar, there's still an issue with that on Oreo and I'm working on it.

Tested on Oreo january and december builds (should also work on Nougat).
